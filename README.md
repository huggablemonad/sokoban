Sokoban
=======
An Elm implementation of Sokoban, a type of transport puzzle.

There are 50 levels included. These levels are the same as the ones found in
`Spectrum Holobyte`'s 1984 `DOS` game. The level layouts, which were converted
to `ASCII`, come from the [xsok](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/xsok) package.

The live demo can be found at <https://huggablemonad.github.io/sokoban/>.
